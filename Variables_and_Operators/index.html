  <p>What the hell is 64-bit floating point?</p>
  <p>Double-precision floating-point format (sometimes called FP64 or float64) is a floating-point number format, usually occupying 64 bits in computer memory; it represents a wide dynamic range of numeric values by using a floating radix point.</p>

  <h1>TOP Course Exercises</h1>
  <p>1. Add two numbers together:</p>
  <p  id="ex1"></p>
    <script>
      console.log(27 + 97); 
      document.getElementById("ex1").innerHTML = (27 + 97);
    </script>

  <p>2. Add a sequence of 6 different numbers together:</p>
  <p  id="ex2"></p>
    <script>
      console.log(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6);
      document.getElementById("ex2").innerHTML = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6;
    </script>

  <p>3. Print the value of the following expression: (4 + 6 + 9) / 77 </p>
  <p  id="ex3"></p>
    <script> 
      console.log((4 + 6 + 9) / 77);
      document.getElementById("ex3").innerHTML = (4 + 6 + 9) / 77;
    </script>

  <p>4. Let's use variables!</p>
  <p id ="ex4">Check Console!</p>
    <script>
      let a = 10;
      let b = 7 * a; 

    </script>
  <p>5. You should be getting the hang of this by nowâ€¦ try this sequence: </p>
  <p id = "ex5">Check console!</p>
    <script>
      const MAX = 57; 
      let actual = MAX - 13; 
      let percentage = actual / MAX;
    </script>
  
  <p> 
    As you might have noticed by running JavaScript code in the console, the console prints the result of the code it executes (called a return statement). You will learn more about these in the next lessons, however for now it is good to remember that a declaration with an assignment (such as let b = 7 * a) returns undefined and so you cannot declare and assign a value to a variable and read its value in the same line.

<!-- IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment-->
<!-- 
Use getELementById().innerHTML when you want to see the result in the HTML file: 

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = 5 + 6;
